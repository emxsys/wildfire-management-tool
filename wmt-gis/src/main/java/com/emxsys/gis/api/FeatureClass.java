 * <ul>
 * <li>Points— Features that are too small to represent as lines or polygons as well as point
 * locations (such as a GPS observations).
 * <li>Lines— Represent the shape and location of geographic objects, such as street centerlines and
 * streams, too narrow to depict as areas. Lines are also used to represent features that have
 * length but no area such as contour lines and boundaries.
 * <li>Polygons— A set of many-sided area features that represent the shape and location of
 * homogeneous feature types such as states, counties, parcels, soil types, and land-use zones.
 * <li>Annotation— Map text including properties for how the text is rendered. For example, in
 * addition to the text string of each annotation, other properties are included such as the shape
 * points for placing the text, its font and point size, and other display properties. Annotation
 * can also be feature-linked and can contain subclasses.
 * <li>Dimensions— A special kind of annotation that shows specific lengths or distances, for
 * example, to indicate the length of a side of a building, a land parcel, or the distance between
 * two features. Dimensions are heavily used in design, engineering, and facilities applications for
 * GIS.
 * <li>Multipoints— Features that are composed of more than one point. Multipoints are often used to
 * manage arrays of very large point collections such as LIDAR point clusters which can contain
 * literally billions of points. Using a single row for such point geometry is not feasible.
 * Clustering these into multipoint rows enables the geodatabase to handle massive point sets.
 * <li>Multipatches— A 3D geometry used to represent the outer surface, or shell, of features that
 * occupy a discrete area or volume in three-dimensional space. Multipatches comprise planar 3D
 * rings and triangles that are used in combination to model a three-dimensional shell. Multipatches
 * can be used to represent anything from simple objects, such as spheres and cubes, or complex
 * objects, such as iso-surfaces and buildings.
 * <li>Null— A null shape, with no geometric data for the shape. Often null shapes are place
 * holders; they are used during shapefile creation and are populated with geometric data soon after
 * they are created.
