## Wildfire Management Tool (WMT)  version 4. ##
WMT is a software application based on the Campbell Prediction System (CPS) that estimates the potential behavior of a wildland fire so that firefighting strategies can ensure the safety and effectiveness of firefighters. WMT is a visualization tool for wildland fire behavior students, instructors and tacticians. The purpose of this tool is to provide an analysis of the potential fire behavior, and to visualize the areas of risk and/or opportunity. The project is an effort to enhance the training of wildland firefighters and fire behavior analysts, and to provide useful fire behavior estimates on active wildland fires and analyses of historical fires. WMT uses the Terramenta project which provides the NASA WorldWind virtual globe.
