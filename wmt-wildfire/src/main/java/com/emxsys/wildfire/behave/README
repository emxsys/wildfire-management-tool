================
I obtained the wf.rothermel package from the ForestFire example
that is included in the DEVSJAVA Examples.zip
    http://www.acims.arizona.edu/SOFTWARE/devsjava3.0/Examples.zip

The wf.rothermel.Behave class and its wrappers have been modified and
integrated into the com.emxsys.behave package.

Following are the orginal release notes from the Behave.java author,
Andreas Bachmann.

   Uncertainty Propagation in Wildland Fire Behaviour Modelling
   ============================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
Behave.java is main JAVA-programs for calculating wildland fire
behavior according to Rothermel (1972) and Albini
(1976). BehaveDeriv.java allows the determination of uncertainty
propagation applying a first order Taylor series. For convenience two
additional programs, i.e. BehaveTest.java and BehaveDerivTest.java,
have been added that serves as some sort of `wrappers'. After compilation
you will be able to run the calculations using these wrappers together
with some properties file, as they are provided in the
wf/data/-subdirectory.

2. COMPILING
------------

  1. Unpack the tar using something like:
	     tar -xvf wf.tar

  2. Have a look at the makefile and adjust the path for the
     JAVA-compiler and your classpath

  3. compile the classes with:
		 make

*NOTE* I tested the programs on a Solaris 7 system with a jdk version
1.3.0 (if I type java -version I get the following:
  java version "1.3.0"
  Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0-RC)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0-RC, mixed mode)


3. USE IT
---------
Run the Wrappers BehaveTest.class and BehaveDerivTest.class, e.g. with:
    java -classpath ${classpath} wf.rothermel.BehaveTest nffl2.prp

It produces some (hopefully) readable output at the commandline. An
80x42 terminal is actually the best size.

4. INFO

the JAVA-programs and the properties files come without any warranty
