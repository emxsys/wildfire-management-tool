 * The zoom factor is directly proportional to the magnification of the scene being viewed.
 * The relationship between zoom and FOV is slightly more complex, and is given by the following:
 *
 * fov = 2 * arctan(1 / zoom)
 * zoom = 1 / tan(fov / 2)  *
 * where fov is the horizontal or width-wise Field Of View (ie. in the camera's horizontal plane
 * and the image's x-direction). It must be in radians if the trigonometric functions use radians
 * instead of degrees. (Degree-radian conversions here.)
 * Note that a zoom value of exactly 1 gives a 90 degree horizontal FOV, but a zoom of 2 does not
 * give a horizontal FOV of 45 degrees.
