        <p>Wildland firefighters face variations in fire behavior that can be 
            predicable, but unfortunately, too many fire fighters lack the training 
            and knowledge to foresee these changes, resulting in unsafe and/or ineffective 
            tactics that can lead to burnover accidents and/or the inefficient use 
            of resources. The development of a reliable prediction system that would 
            mitigate these problems included drawing upon the first hand experiences 
            of seasoned firefighters, investigating the commonalities in burnover 
            accident reports, analyzing and challenging fire weather and fuel moisture 
            concepts, developing and field testing prediction and tactics on wildland 
            fires and prescribed burns. The Campbell Prediction System has been 
            developed to explain how firefighters can make predictions of fire behavior 
            changes that may occur at any time, and make these predictions while 
            on the fireline. This prediction system has been field-tested and validated 
            on wildland fires and has prevented deaths and injuries of fire fighters 
            from burnovers.</p>
        <h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
        <p>Wildland firefighters face variations in fire behavior that occur 
            under all fire danger situations. Some firefighters instinctively know 
            when and where the variations may occur. Unfortunately, firefighters 
            who do not know these things have a reduced situational awareness. Many 
            burnover situations could have been avoided had they known how dangerous 
            the fire potential was, and had they told others how they knew. Reading 
            accident reports from the 1949 Mann Gulch through the 2006 Esperanza 
            fires reveals that had the simple knowledge of when and where the variation 
            was about to occur would have made a difference. <em>It is better to 
                leave early, rather than to stay until the fire runs you out.</em></p>
        <p>The Campbell Prediction System (CPS) is a practical way to use on-scene 
            observations to determine fire behavior strategies and tactics. With 
            the Campbell Prediction System, logic replaces intuition, allowing an 
            explanation of how tactics are developed. Scientific research combined 
            with the knowledge of the successful firefighters&#39; methods and practices 
            are used to explain fire behavior. In these situations the observed 
            fire behavior becomes the baseline, or signature, for fire behavior 
            predictions.</p>
        <p>The Campbell Prediction System enables you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and use the correct information to make fire behavior 
                predictions </li>
            <li>Explain how you arrived at your prediction of fire behavior 
                change</li>
            <li>Choose the tactic or strategy to utilize and explain how it 
                was selected</li>
            <li>Display and communicate the predicted fire behavior on a map</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logic allows an explanation of what the fire is telling you, and 
            reasoned tactics maintain effectiveness and safety.</p>
        <h3><a name="The_Situation">The Situation</a></h3>
        <p>Wildfire suppression tactics are sometimes unsafe and can result 
            in injuries and/or fatalities from burnovers. Prescribed burning projects 
            sometimes escape control due to poor planning or execution.(1) Tactics 
            fail as a result of fire behavior predictions that are either not made 
            or are inaccurate.(2) Why do these events occur?</p>
        <p>Firefighters do not have a simple and reliable method to assess the 
            fire and fireground situations. Firefighters are taught to think about 
            suppressing the fire and not to think logically of how the fire could 
            thwart their plan. The firefighter&#39;s emotional hook to <em>fight fire</em> 
            to often outweighs a logical approach and can lead to accidents. Firefighters 
            that cannot explain the factors that cause fires to transition from 
            controllable to beyond human control are more at risk.</p>
        <p>Current training points to a dependence on staying informed of the 
            air temperature, relative humidity, and the forecast wind direction 
            and speed. These are generalities that are not specific to time and 
            place; this data is not the best information to base a tactical plan 
            on. Unfortunately, most scenarios use these fire danger elements and 
            incorrectly expect that accurate fire behavior predictions can be made.</p>
        <p>Statistics show that there is a weakness in the training of firefighters. 
            Many rules and fixes for the problem have been implemented with no significant 
            reduction in burnovers. Accident reports assign causes of fatalities 
            to these weaknesses. Some blame it on attitude or leadership deficiencies. 
            Others blame it on failure to obey the rules and &quot;watch outs.&quot;(3) Reducing 
            the rate of burnover and shelter deployments will require a new approach.</p>

        <h3><a name="Secrets_of_the_Successful_Firefighter">Secrets of the Successful Firefighter</a></h3><p>Campbell 
            writes, &quot;In 1966, the Loop Fire (Angeles National Forest, CA) burned 
            over the El Cariso Hotshot crew. The superintendent in charge had years 
            of experience and was, in my opinion, a very knowledgeable firefighter. 
            I came to the conclusion that if he could be caught in a burnover situation, 
            then anyone could. That accident started my search for what was missing 
            in our training. I wanted to find out what the successful leaders who 
            worked on fires for years and avoided entrapments knew that others did 
            not. That may be the secret.</p>
        <p>&quot;I sought to discover the secrets of the successful firefighter. 
            My curiosity began with asking, &#39;How did you know what was going to 
            happen?&#39; No one could explain to me how he or she knew what the fire 
            was going to do in the near future.<br>Asking my mentors the same question 
            over the years, I failed to get the answers that I sought. Apparently 
            the knowledge was intuitive and did not lend itself to a simple set 
            of spoken words and phrases to explain the situation or the cause of 
            the change.</p>
        <p>&quot;I set out to discover how the experienced firefighters came to conclusions. 
            I would have to explain, show, and prove how one could view the scene 
            and arrive at a reliable prediction and tactic. Examining the training 
            programs and literature over a period of years, I centered on the primary 
            causes of fire behavior variations.&quot;(5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)<br></p>
        <h3><strong><a name="Reading_a_Wildland_Fire">Reading a Wildland Fire</a></strong></h3>
        <p>There are three primary 
            forces causing <em><strong>variations</strong></em> in fire behavior. 
            They are wind, slope, and pre-heat.(11)When these forces align, the 
            fire is going to be at its maximum intensity. When these forces are 
            not in alignment, the intensity is lower than the maximum. This is the 
            alignment of forces concept. Each side of a fire, the head, flanks and 
            heel, has a different alignment and intensity. For example, if the head 
            is in alignment with the wind, then the flanks and heel will be out 
            of alignment. Each of these alignment sets produces a fire signature, 
            which is the observed fire behavior within the current alignment of 
            forces. The fire signature is the ground truth. It is how the fire will 
            behave in similar conditions.</p>
        <p>The terrain will host replications of these fire signatures on those 
            exposures that have a similar alignment. Where and when the alignment 
            of forces in the path of the fire is similar to those of a previous 
            fire signature, the fire behavior will be similar. When we identify 
            how these forces are aligned ahead of the fire, and have paid attention 
            to previous fire signatures, then we can more accurately predict the
            <em>fire signature that will result.</em></p>
        <p>What is important for situational awareness is when and where the 
            fire signature will exceed the threshold of safety for the firefighter. 
            This awareness becomes more accurate with practice.</p>
        <p>A trigger point is a place on the terrain where a change in the alignment 
            of forces will change the fire behavior, creating either opportunity 
            or danger. Trigger points are a time and/or place the tactic or placement 
            of resources needs to be changed to assure firefighter safety. There 
            are two crucial trigger points to establish: one is where the fire will 
            change; the other is when and where fire on the landscape triggers a 
            decision to change tactics. Selecting a trigger point of change or the 
            trigger point for tactical adjustment requires firsthand experience. 
            Neither trigger point was established when the 1985 Butte Fire made 
            an in-alignment run and drove firefighters into fire shelters.(12)</p>

        <p>The following 
            is a case study showing the successful application of this method on 
            the 1994 Dillon Fire, in the Klamath National Forest (California)</p>
        <p>The Dillon Fire was located southwest of Dillon Creek. On the afternoon 
            of August 12 at the peak of the solar heating time (1600 hours) it moved 
            to a place where it was in full alignment with slope, wind and preheat: 
            on the SW aspect with a SW wind. From there, the fire made a run to 
            the top of the ridge through timber crowns with 150-foot flames. The 
            following day, a small spot fire on top of a knob was detected by an 
            early morning infrared flight. A firing operation along the burnout 
            line had begun on the previous day shift and was planned for the following 
            day shift, the day of the fire run.</p>
        <p>Figure 2 is a shaded relief map illustrating this situation. The 
            fire&#39;s run on the SW aspect is indicated with a red arrow on the left 
            within the orange shading of the main fire. The wind direction is depicted 
            with a blue arrow in the lower left. The burnout line and firing operation 
            can be seen to the north and east of the main fire, as indicated by 
            the brown line along the ridgeline and the firefighter icons. The spot 
            fire is located between the main fire perimeter and the lower end of 
            the firing operation.</p>
        <p align="center">

            Figure 2. Dillon Fire Situation Assessment.<br></p>
        <p>The Plans Section staff showed this information to the Fire Behavior 
            Analyst and Operations Chief. The conversation went thusly:</p>
        <p>This fire burned through the night and will continue to burn and 
            move downhill. After the inversion burns off over the area, the fire 
            will move faster. Let&#39;s identify where the fire may threaten the firefighters 
            on the line.</p>
        <p>The trigger point for a run is at the bottom of the canyon. There 
            the fire will be in alignment with wind and slope on a hot aspect. When 
            this happened before, the fire launched to the crowns of the timber 
            and produced 150-foot flame lengths. The fire is telling you how it 
            will behave. That run is very likely to occur sometime after 1600 hours. 
            We recommend the firefighters on that entire burnout and holding operation 
            be evacuated by 1100 hours.</p>
        <p>At noon, the firefighters were sent to a safety area and the fire 
            made a run with the same signature as noted before. No personnel were 
            in the track of the fire when it made its run. The fire burned over 
            the ridge, and like the fire signature of the previous day&#39;s run, it 
            replicated to a slow moving ground fire that was quickly contained.<br>
            Figure 3 is an illustration depicting the potential fire behavior on 
            that day. It is similar to the actual graphic used on the fire. The 
            fire&#39;s <em>predicted tracks</em> are red arrows that emanate from
            <em>trigger points</em> depicted with T&#39;s. The burnout tactic was
            <em>time-tagged</em> to be off line at 1100. This illustration also 
            shows the actual run that the fire made on August 13, at 1732 hours, 
            represented by the orange shading in the center.</p>

        <p align="center">Figure 3. Dillon Fire trigger points, predictions 
            and tactics.</p>
        <p>The behavior of the Dillon Fire has many similarities with the well-documented 
            1994 South Canyon Fire. (13) Figure 4 compares the Dillon and South 
            Canyon terrain, and shows the spot fires and the fire runs made by both 
            fires. The two fires are displayed side by side; the Dillon Fire is 
            on the left and the South Canyon Fire is on the right. In both cases, 
            the crews were working <em>indirect. </em>On the Dillon fire the crews 
            were firing out the ridge top when a spot fire was located on a hilltop 
            between the main fire and the firing job. Both fires had been burning 
            all night and would continue burning out of alignment with slope until 
            they reached the bottom of the canyon.</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img alt="So" height="388" src="campbell_cps_clip_image006.jpg" width="552"><br>
            Dillon 8/14/1994&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            South Canyon 7/6/1994<br>Figure 4.&nbsp; Dillon and South Canyon Fire 
            Comparison</p>
        <p>The similarities of the two fires are not unique. The fire situation 
            began on a hilltop and backed downward to a trigger point where the 
            fire found terrain that was in alignment. The trigger point for a run 
            in alignment with wind, slope and near the peak time of the solar heating 
            period is shown at the start of the arrows. The arrow indicates the 
            track the fire took. The Dillon made its run at 1732 hours, the South 
            Canyon at 1630 hours.</p>
        <p>The difference, however, is in the outcome. The South Canyon firefighters 
            failed to understand the fire&#39;s potential and they ran the escape route 
            after the fire began its run. Thirteen firefighters perished. On the 
            Dillon, the threat and trigger point were identified in advance and 
            the firefighters were evacuated from the path before the run started.</p>
        <p>There are many fires where this system could have made a difference 
            in the outcome. CPS class exercises allow students to create solutions 
            for some of the fatality fires.(14)</p>
        <h3><font size="+1"><a name="Using_the_Correct_Information">Using the Correct Information for Fire Behavior 
                    Predictions</a></font></h3>
        <p>Across the fireground, within a single fuel type on any given day, 
            variations can be observed in the fire&#39;s intensity, rate of spread, 
            and consumption of live and dead fuel. The primary forces that cause 
            these variations are various alignments of<strong><em> wind, slope and 
                    preheat</em></strong> in the path of the fire.</p>
        <div align="left">
            Wind and slope both act on a fire by changing the angle and orientation 
            of the flame with respect to the fuel bed; preheat is a force that 
            alters the fire&#39;s intensity. Solar heated fuels ignite more readily 
            than cooler fuels. Solar preheating is a force multiplier when applied 
            to the wind and slope vectors. Figure 5 shows how the magnitude 
            of solar preheating in the fuel bed varies by time of day and slope 
            aspect.<br></div>
        <div align="center">

        <br>Figure 5. Solar Preheating by Time of Day and Aspect (15) Countryman 
        1966<p></p>
        <p>The effects of wind and slope on a fire are well understood, however, 
            the topic of solar preheating and its effects on fuel moisture and fuel 
            temperature warrant further discussion. Air temperature and relative 
            humidity do not cause the differences in fuel flammability but instead, 
            it is the microclimatic variations influenced by solar radiation that 
            cause variations in fuel flammability and fire behavior. (15) (16) (17)<br>
            <br />
            Solar radiation affects the moisture content of the fine fuels during 
            the daytime. On a sunny day, the solar radiation is heating the surface 
            of the sunlit fuels and driving off moisture. The relative humidity 
            is regulating how fast moisture can be driven off by radiation, but 
            it&#39;s the radiation that&#39;s heating and drying the fuel. Conversely, shaded 
            fuels have more moisture content.<br><br />
            Measuring the differences in temperature between sunlit and shaded fuels 
            in the fine fuel beds shows they correlate to fuel flammability variation. 
            Fuel temperature variation is easy to measure and has a more direct 
            effect on fuel moisture than calculations of humidity. Figure 6 shows 
            the fuel temperature being measured on sunlit and shaded fuel beds using 
            an infrared thermometer. The sunlit fuel is 104 degrees F whereas the 
            shaded fuel is 71degrees F. When these photos were taken, the air temperature 
            was measured at 70degrees F and the relative humidity measured 30%. 
            Your observations of fire signatures in both solar preheated fuel and 
            shaded fuel will tell you how much difference it makes in fire intensity.</p>

        <p>To establish the fuel flammability curves for a specific location 
            use the Shadommeter (Figure 7). The Shadommeter was used on fires to 
            determine the time each aspect reached the peak solar heating period 
            and to determine the surface temperature variation.</p>

        <p>To utilize this idea in a predictive way, categorize the various 
            terrain aspects as <em>hot fuel beds</em> and <em>cool fuel beds</em> 
            that are either <em>heating up</em> or <em>cooling down</em>. Hot fuels 
            burn with more intensity than cooler fuels because the temperature is 
            closer to ignition and the fuel is dryer. The effects of solar preheating 
            can be seen in the following photographs (Figure 8) from the Zaca Fire. 
            These photos represent four changes in the fire signature of a topography 
            fire that is out of alignment with wind and slope but in a fuel bed 
            that is being heated and dried by the solar effect. Note how the fire 
            intensity increases as the sunlit fuels are heated throughout the day.</p>

        <p>Prediction of fire behavior change becomes simpler when you use the 
            fire behavior elements of wind, slope and preheat to explain the cause 
            of the variations in fire intensity and flame lengths.</p>
        <h3><font size="+1"><a name="How_to_Predict_Fire_Behavior_Change">How to Predict Fire Behavior Change</a> </font></h3>
        <p>Here we have an example of how to use the CPS logic, information 
            and language to predict and explain fire behavior changes. Figure 9 
            shows two photographs of a test burn. (18) In these photos, there are 
            sunlit and shaded fuels and a 3 mph wind blowing from left to right; 
            the head fire in the left hand photo has 10&#39; flame lengths. Wind, slope 
            and preheat are acting on the fire to either help or hinder the spread. 
            The alignment of these forces make the fire burn with more intensity 
            and when the forces are out of alignment the fire behavior ebbs. Observe 
            how the fire signatures change as the alignment of forces change. Examine 
            these snapshots and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is making the fire burn with different intensities?</li>
            <li>What is the <strong><em>cause</em></strong> of the variations 
                seen in these two pictures?</li>
            <li>What is the fire telling us?</li>

            <strong>Isolating Information: </strong>The upper left-hand flank 
            (S-2), the lower right-hand flank (S-3), and the heel of the fire 
            (S-1) will not change alignments with the forces of wind, slope 
            and preheat. Therefore the fire will continue to advance with the 
            same intensity and rate of spread on these fronts. However, the 
            fire signature at S-5 will change because the force alignments change 
            between S-4 and S-5: the fire moves out of alignment with slope 
            and into cool fuel. The S-5 signature will replicate the fire signature 
            of S-3, as can be seen in the right hand photo.<p></p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Knowing there will be a reduction in flame 
            length when the fire gets to the S-5 location, it makes sense to wait 
            and engage the fire after it goes out of alignment. (19) You&#39;ll<em> 
                notice that neither air temperature nor humidity measurements are necessary 
                to make this prediction.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Language: It is important to wait and see what the fire does 
                as it burns into a different area. The slope, solar preheat and wind 
                on the fire will change. </strong>This fire went out of alignment with 
            wind, slope and preheat when it burned over the small ridge. It was 
            a topography ruled fire with wind domination. If the wind quits the 
            fire will turn up slope. To suppress this fire enter the fire at S-3 
            and work along the S-2 flank using the burn as the safety area. When 
            the fire goes out of alignment then turn the corner with a direct attack 
            on what was the head. This is a two or three person hand crew task.</p>
        <p>Understanding the alignment of forces on a topography fire and knowing 
            how to describe the fire in terms of alignments goes a long way toward 
            seeing where the fire will get worse or easier. [T] Is the trigger point 
            of fire behavior change that becomes an opportunity for control. Explaining 
            the fire before selecting the tactics is an important safety issue. 
            This is a lesson in how to compare the alignment of forces to the fire 
            signatures and predict changes before they occur. The fire signature 
            at S-5 is an out of alignment signature and it replicates the shaded 
            lower flank signature S-3.</p>
        <h3><font size="+1"><a name="Logic_for_Tactics_and_Strategies">Logic for Tactics and Strategies</a></font></h3>
        <p>Tactics need to be considered when and/or where there may be significant 
            variations in the fire behavior. Knowing when and where fire behavior 
            will change for the better or worse is crucial to firefighter safety 
            and situational awareness. The best relationship for a tactical advantage 
            is to engage the fire during the time the fire is getting easier rather 
            than worse. To borrow from Sun Tzu, &quot;attack when your enemy is lax.&quot;(19)</p>
        <p>The dominant force could change from slope, to wind, to preheating. 
            Any one of these forces can dominate the fire behavior. This is important 
            because if the dominant force changes, the character of the fire will 
            change also. For instance, a wind driven fire will, in effect, flatten 
            the effects of terrain and reduce fuel temperature and moisture variations. 
            When this fire burns to a location that is sheltered from wind, a new 
            dominant force will drive the fire. For example:</p>
        <p>In California, a strong Santa Ana wind drives the fire toward the 
            Pacific coast and then weakens on the third day. Now slope and preheat 
            forces come into play. The fire will behave differently because the 
            dominant force has changed. The tactical match for the type of fire 
            needs to be adjusted (see Table 1). Now there may be opportunity, but 
            also danger because it has become less stable.</p>
        <p>Each type of fire requires a different tactical approach. Wind driven 
            fires require a flanking attack. Fuel dominated fires require an indirect 
            attack. Topography fires require a tactical evaluation and the use of 
            time tags.</p>

            alignment with the forces on the fire to develop new fire signature 
            concepts. Recalibration of the fire signatures needs to be done whenever 
            the fire burns into another fuel type, when the dominant force changes, 
            or when there are significant differences over time or terrain. A wise

            <li>Draw the wind direction on the map (Figure 2)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Identifying the trigger point of where or when fire behavior will 
            change is an important tactical procedure. Time tagging a tactic based 
            on previous fire signatures helps identify dangerous tactical time periods. 
            In the preceding photos of the Zaca Fire (Figure 8), we saw evidence 
            of what solar heating variations over time will do to a fire. Although 
            the fire spread is out of alignment with slope and wind, it is spreading 
            on a west aspect and the preheating is going up the curve. The best 
            time period to attack with good results would be before 1400 or after 
            sunset when the solar preheating force-multiplier is gone. Crew supervisors 
            should develop their tactical plan after viewing their assignments and 
            make adjustments such as time tags.</p>

        <p><strong>Technological Advances</strong><br>New tools are being used 
            to augment the collection of fire behavior observations, and to enhance 
            the fire behavior prediction opportunity.</p>
        <p>Bruce Schubert of AeroComputers has developed an airborne system, 
            which leverages aircraft-mounted gyro-stabilized cameras (infrared and/or 
            daylight) to gather wildland fire behavior signatures, and to map the 
            perimeter of these fires by simply tracing the fireline with the camera&#39;s 
            cross hairs. This system produces GIS shapefiles and both geo-referenced 
            video and screenshots of fire signatures to aid in the evaluation of 
            past and current fire behavior. The system continuously geo-references 
            live video so that the latitude and longitude of the cross hairs displayed 
            on the operator&#39;s screen are recorded. At the same time, the AeroComputers 
            system overlays scale bars on the video image to measure flame height 
            and help provide context to the live video being collected. The data 
            can be simultaneously transmitted to the ground for immediate consumption.

        <p>Schubert is designing a decision support and training tool that integrates 
            the disciplines of GIS and the new field of data mining with the logic 
            embodied by CPS to render potential fire behavior and the thresholds 
            of control in the path of a fire. This system will determine potential 
            fire behavior across the fireground by analyzing the observations from 
            an active fire plus an aggregate of observations from past fires. The 
            system is being designed for use in the classroom and the Situation

        <h3><font size="+1"><a name="Conclusions">Conclusions</a></font></h3>
        <p>Much of the fire behavior training prior to the final advanced fire 
            behavior class (S-490) was designed to enable students to accomplish 
            fire-modeling tasks. The Fire Behavior Analyst is part of the fire team 
            who attempts to utilize the training to add to the information in the 
            Incident Action Plan. How does it work when developing a tactical approach 
            on wildland fires? Experienced firefighters used their intuition to 
            fight fire effectively and safely for years. How the successful ones 
            accomplished dangerous jobs is not well known. They did not use the 
            fire modeling system to accomplish the tasks.</p>
        <p>The Campbell Prediction System was developed to augment the fire 
            modeling design weakness as described by scientist Richard Rothermel.&nbsp; 
            Rothermel has long had the distinction of being the Guru of fire behavior 
            for wildland fire prediction. His evaluation of his invention follows.(23)<br>
            <br>&quot;The mathematical model has application to management problems in 
            two situations:<br>1.&nbsp; The &quot;hypothetical fire&quot; situation in which 
            operations&#39; research techniques are utilized for fire planning, fire 
            training, and fuel appraisal. </p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; The &quot;possible fire&quot; situation for which advance planning 
            is needed, such as fire-danger rating and pre-suppression planning. 
            Predictions of potential fire severity for possible management practices 
            (i.e., methods of thinning, slash treatment and prescribed burning) 
            have the potential for being the most valuable contribution that fire 
            modeling can perform.</p>
        <p>A third situation -- forecasting the behavior of existing wildfires 
            -- will require a greater degree of sophistication than this model and 
            our knowledge of fuels will permit at the present time. Variations in 
            fuel and weather cause departures from predicted spread and intensity 
            that pose risks unacceptable in fire suppression activities. A method 
            for forecasting the behavior of a specific fire eventually will be developed; 
            most likely, it will be patterned on a probability basis similar to 
            that used for forecasting weather. To accomplish this, a technique must 
            be developed for rapidly updating fuel inventories on the threatened 
            site.</p>
        <p>CPS has been on many wildland fires. The logic program and fire signature 
            concepts have been field-tested while operating as a Type Two Incident 
            Commander, Type One Operations Section Chief and as a Fire Behavior 
            Analyst and it was accepted well and worked well.&nbsp; During a ten-year 
            period while working for the Ventura County Fire Department as the Fire 
            Behavior Analyst, CPS was tested and improved on over ninety prescribed 
            burns.<br><br>During the past eighteen years Doug Campbell has taught 
            CPS to more than thirty five hundred firefighters in the U.S., Spain 
            and Canada.&nbsp; A two-day investment has produced logic in the firefighter&#39;s 
            toolbox and a way to explain how they know how the fire will behave 
            and how they modified the tactic and remained effective and safe during 
            hazardous situations.&nbsp; The accuracy and viability of the method 
            student evaluation rated the program over 90% very useful. Those who 
            have attended this training program have reported they have used this 
            information and avoided potential burnovers.</p>
        <p>There are numerous fire personnel who have utilized CPS on wildland 
            fires and are qualified to teach the subject.&nbsp; Doug Campbell has 
            retired from teaching.&nbsp; He is however open to teach instructors 
            and furnishing the course material on a one-on-one basis to those individuals 
            interested in instructing the CPS course.<br></p>
