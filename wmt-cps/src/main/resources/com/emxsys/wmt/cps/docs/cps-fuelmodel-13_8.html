        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 8</h1>
        <h2>Closed Timber Litter</h2>
        <h3>Timber Group</h3>
        <p>Slow-burning ground fires with low flame lengths are generally the case, although
            the fire may encounter an occasional “jackpot” or heavy fuel concentration that
            can flare up. Only under severe weather conditions involving high temperatures,
            low humidities, and high winds do the fuels pose fire hazards. Closed canopy stands
            of short-needle conifers or hardwoods that have leafed out support fire in the compact
            litter layer. This layer is mainly needles, leaves, and occasionally twigs because
            little undergrowth is present in the stand. Representative conifer types are white
            pine, and lodgepole pine, spruce, fir, and larch.&nbsp; Photographs 22, 23, and 24 illustrate the situations
            representative of this fuel.</p>
