        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 6</h1>
        <h2>Dormant Brush, Hardwood Slash</h2>
        <h3>Shrub Group</h3>

        <p>Fires carry through the shrub layer where the foliage is
            more flammable than fuel model 5, but this requires
            moderate winds, greater than 8 mi/h (13 km/h) at midflame
            height. Fire will drop to the ground at low wind
            speeds or at openings in the stand. The shrubs are older,
            but not as tall as shrub types of model 4, nor do they
            contain as much fuel as model 4. A broad range of shrub
            conditions is covered by this model. Fuel situations to be
            considered include intermediate stands of chamise,
            chaparral, oak brush, low pocosin, Alaskan spruce taiga,
            and shrub tundra. Even hardwood slash that has cured
            can be considered. Pinyon-juniper shrublands may be
            represented but may overpredict rate of spread except at
            high winds, like 20 mi/h (32 km/h) at the 20-foot level. Photographs 15, 16, 17,
		and 18 show situations encompassed by this fuel model.</p>
