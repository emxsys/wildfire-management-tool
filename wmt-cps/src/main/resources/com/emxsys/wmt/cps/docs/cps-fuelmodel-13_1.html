        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 1</h1>
        <h2>Short Grass (1 foot)</h2>
        <h3>Grass Group</h3>
        <p>Fire spread is governed by the fine, very porous, and
            continuous herbaceous fuels that have cured or are
            nearly cured. Fires are surface fires that move rapidly
            through the cured grass and associated material. Very
            little shrub or timber is present, generally less than one-third
            of the area.</p>
        <p>Grasslands and savanna are represented along with
            stubble, grass-tundra, and grass-shrub combinations that
            met the above area constraint. Annual and perennial
            grasses are included in this fuel model. Refer to photographs
            1, 2, and 3 for illustrations.</p>
