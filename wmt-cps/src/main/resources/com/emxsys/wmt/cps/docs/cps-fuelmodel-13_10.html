        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 10</h1>
        <h2>Timber (Litter and Understory)</h2>
        <h3>Timber Group</h3>
        <p>The fires burn in the surface and ground fuels with greater fire intensity than
            the other timber litter models. Dead-down fuels include greater quantities of 3-inch
            (7.6-cm) or larger limbwood resulting from overmaturity or natural events that create
            a large load of dead material on the forest floor. Crowning out, spotting, and torching
            of individual trees are more frequent in this fuel situation, leading to potential
            fire control difficulties. Any forest type may be considered if heavy down material
            is present; examples are insect- or disease-ridden stands, windthrown stands, overmature
            situations with deadfall, and aged light thinning or partial-cut slash. The fuel
            model G is depicted in photographs 28, 29, and 30.</p>
