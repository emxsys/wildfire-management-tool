<h1>Standard Fire Behavior Fuel Models: A Comprehensive Set for Use with Rothermel’s 
Surface Fire Spread Model</h1>
<p>Joe H. Scott<br>Robert E. Burgan</p>
<p>This new set of standard fire behavior fuel models is designed to stand alone; 
none of the original 13 fire behavior fuel models is repeated in the new set; the 
fuel model selection guide points to the new fuel models only. However, the original 
13 fire behavior fuel models will still be available, and they are still called 
fire behavior fuel models 1- 13. There is no immediate need to reanalyze existing 
fuel model maps or lookup tables that are sufficient for their purpose. However, 
we anticipate that new fuel model mapping projects will use this new set rather 
than the original 13.</p>
<p>Documentation and naming of the new fuel models refer to fuel or fuel types, 
not vegetation or vegetation types. For example, what was formerly termed a “Chaparral” 
fuel model might now be called a “Heavy Load, Tall Brush” model because one fuel 
model can be applied in many vegetation types. Likewise, the fuel model selection 
guide does not refer to specific vegetation types except as necessary to illustrate 
an example.</p>
<p>In this new set, all fuel models with an herbaceous component are dynamic. In 
a dynamic fuel model, live herbaceous load is transferred to dead as a function 
of the live herbaceous moisture content. Although the new fuel model parameters 
can be input to a nondynamic fire behavior processor, that approach does not produce 
the intended result. Using the dynamic fuel models in a nondynamic fire behavior 
model would leave the live herbaceous load in the live category, regardless of moisture 
content. The grass models will therefore predict no (or very little) spread and 
intensity under any wind or moisture condition. The change to dynamic fuel models 
is really a change in both the fire behavior processors and, concurrently, how fuel 
models for grass- or herbaceousdominated fuelbeds are conceived. In this case, our 
desire for grass and herbaceous fuel models that could be used at various levels 
of curing precipitated the change in fire behavior processors.</p>
