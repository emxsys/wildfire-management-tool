        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Models - The Original 13</h1>
        <p>This help text contains excerpts from USFS General Technical Report

        <h2>Aids to Determining Fuel Models For Estimating Fire Behavior</h2>
        <h3>Hal E. Anderson</h3>
        <h2>HOW FUEL MODELS ARE DESCRIBED</h2>
        <p>Fuels have been classified into four groups—grasses, brush, timber,
		and slash. The differences in fire behavior among these groups are 
		basically related to the fuel load and its distribution among the 
		fuel particle size classes. This can be illustrated by the shift in 
		size class containing the maximum fraction of load when considering 
		the four fuel groups shown in figure 1. Notice that the fraction of 
		the total load in the less than 4-inch (0.6-cm) size class decreases 
		as we go from grasses to slash. The reverse is true for the 1- to 3- 
		inch (2.5- to 7.6-cm) material. In grasses, the entire fuel load may 
		be herbaceous material less than one fourth inch (0.6 cm), but grass 
		may include up to 25 percent material between one-fourth and 1 
		inch (0.6 and 2.5 cm) and up to 10 percent material between 1 and 3 
		inches (2.5 cm and 7.6 cm). Each fuel group has a range of fuel loads 
		for each size class, with maximum fuel load per size class 
		approximately as shown in figure 1.</p>
        <p>Fuel load and depth are significant fuel properties for predicting
		whether a fire will be ignited, its rate of spread, and its 
		intensity. The relationship of fuel load and depth segregates the 13 
		fuel models into two distinctive orientations, with two fuel groups 
		in each (fig. 2). Grasses and brush are vertically oriented fuel 
		groups, which rapidly increase in depth with increasing load. 
		Timber litter and slash are horizontally positioned and slowly 
		increase in depth as the load is increased. Observations of the 
		location and positioning of fuels in the field help one decide which 
		fuel groups are represented. Selection of a fuel model can be 
		simplified if one recognizes those features that distinguish one fuel 
		group from another. </p>
        <p>The 13 fuel models (table 1) under consideration are presented on
		page 92 of Albini’s (1976) paper, “Estimating Wildfire Behavior and 
		Effects.” Each fuel model is described by the fuel load and the ratio 
		of surface area to volume for each size class; the depth of the fuel 
		bed involved in the fire front; and fuel moisture, including that 
		at which fire will not spread, called the moisture of extinction. The 
		descriptions of the fuel models include the total fuel load less than 
		3 inches (7.6 cm), dead fuel load less than one-fourth inch (0.6 cm), 
		live fuel load of less than one-fourth inch (0.6 cm), and herbaceous 
		material and fuel depth used to compute the fire behavior values 
		given in the nomographs.</p>

            The criteria for choosing a fuel model includes the fact
            that the fire burns in the fuel stratum best conditioned to
            support the fire. This means situations will occur where
            one fuel model represents rate of spread most accurately
            and another best depicts fire intensity. In other situations,
            two fuel conditions may exist, so the spread of
            fire across the area must be weighted by the fraction of
            the area occupied by each fuel. Fuel models are simply
            tools to help the user realistically estimate fire behavior.
            The user must maintain a flexible frame of mind and an
            adaptive method of operating to totally utilize these aids.
            For this reason, the fuel models are described in terms of
            both expected fire behavior and vegetation.</p>
        <p>
            The National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS)
            depends upon an ordered set of weather records to
            establish conditions of the day. These weather conditions
            along with the 1978 NFDRS fuel models are used to
            represent the day-to-day and seasonal trends in fire
            danger. Modifications to the fuel models are possible by
            changes in live/dead ratios, moisture content, fuel loads,
            and drought influences by the large fuel effect on fire
            danger. The 13 fuel models for fire behavior estimation
            are for the severe period of the fire season when wildfires
            pose greater control problems and impact on land resources.
            Fire behavior predictions must utilize on-site
            observations and short term data extrapolated from
            remote measurement stations. The field use situation
            generally is one of stress and urgency. Therefore, the
            selection options and modifications for fuel models are
            limited to maintain a reasonably simple procedure to use
            with fire behavior nomographs, moisture content adjustment
            charts, and wind reduction procedures. The NFDRS
            fuel models are part of a computer data processing
            system that presently is not suited to real time, in-thefield
            prediction of fire behavior.</p>
