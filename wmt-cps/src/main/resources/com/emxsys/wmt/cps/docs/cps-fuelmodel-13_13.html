        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 13</h1>
        <h2>Heavy Logging Slash</h2>
        <h3>Logging Slash Group</h3>
        <p>Fire is generally carried across the area by a continuous layer of slash. Large
            quantities of material larger than 3 inches (7.6 cm) are present. Fires spread quickly
            through the fine fuels and intensity builds up more slowly as the large fuels start
            burning. Active flaming is sustained for long periods and a wide variety of firebrands
            can be generated. These contribute to spotting problems as the weather conditions
            become more severe. Clearcuts and heavy partial-cuts in mature and overmature stands
            are depicted where the slash load is dominated by the greater-than-3-inch (7.6-cm)
            diameter material. The total load may exceed 200 tons per acre (89.2 t/ha) but fuel
            less than 3 inches (7.6-cm) is generally only 10 percent of the total load. Situations
            where the slash still has “red” needles attached but the total load is lighter,
            more like model 12, can be represented because of the earlier high intensity and
            quicker area involvement. The fuel model is illustrated in photographs 37 and 38.
            Areas most commonly fitting this model are old-growth stands west of the Cascade
            and Sierra Nevada Mountains. More efficient utilization standards are decreasing
            the amount of large material left in the field.</p>
