        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 12</h1>
        <h2>Medium Logging Slash</h2>
        <h3>Logging Slash Group</h3>
        <p>Rapidly spreading fires with high intensities capable of generating firebrands
            can occur. When fire starts, it is generally sustained until a fuel break or change
            in fuels is encountered. The visual impression is dominated by slash and much of
            it is less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. The fuels total less than 35 tons
            per acre (15.6 t/ha) and seem well distributed. Heavily thinned conifer stands,
            clearcuts, and medium or heavy partial cuts are represented. The material larger
            than 3 inches (7.6 cm) is represented by encountering 11 pieces, 6 inches (15.2
            cm) in diameter, along a 50-foot (15-m) transect. Field situations are presented
            in photographs 34, 35, and 36.</p>
