        <p>
            <strong>A simple way to view the fire ground and to explain how the
			fire will change in intensity.</strong> </p>
        <p>A segment
			of a wildland fire will gain intensity and speed where it finds a time
			or place of more favorable alignment. To communicate this change say;
            &quot;The fire is going into better alignment with ---&quot; (naming the force
			of change.) </p>
        <p>There
            are three primary causative forces present which influence the variations
			in intensity and rate of spread of a wildland fire. As the fire burns
			over the topography, the forces change independently. Each force can
			aid or retard the spread. The forces can work together or cancel each
			others effects out. The three forces usually associated with fire behavior
			are Weather, Topography and Fuel, AKA the fire triangle. </p>
        <p>There
			are many ways to interpret information about weather, topography and
			fuel and this can make a fire behavior prediction complex. How can it
			be made simple? The CPS isolates causative elements that change fire
			intensities. This reduces the data that needs to be considered to make
			predictions of change. The primary forces that cause wildland fires
			to change are wind, slope, and fuel temperature variations. Observations
			of how these forces vary in the path of the fire are the first step
			in predicting changes in the fire behavior potential. A very good rule
			to start with is to fight fire where it is out of alignment.

        <p>A device

			behavior can occur. This candle board demonstrates the variability of
			fire intensity while all factors are the same except the arrangement
			of fire on the board. A line of fire has one signature flame length
			while a zone of fire has another. The difference is caused by the preheating
			differences each arrangement produces. The flame length of the line
			of fire can be induced to factors of ten. Watch out for sprinklers in
			the room when demonstrating this effect. </p>
        <p>The idea
			is to understand that how fire is arranged makes a vast difference in
			the production of flame. The next step is to be able to foresee it happening
			on the fireground and to move out of the way. </p>
        <p>Following
			that, it paves the way to understanding how to manage intensities and
			the amount of fuel consumption on prescribed burning operations to the

            <a name="fire behavior info">Fire Behavior Information</a></h2>
        <p>Variations
			of wind, slope, solar heating of fuels ( fuel temperature) are fire
			behavior information. The variations in these forces are the direct
			cause of fire behavior change. These variations are observable.
        </p>
        <p>Fire
			behavior information excludes generalizations made to express conditions
			in the area of the fire such as air temperature, relative humidity,
			fuel moisture content, live fuel moisture content, and wind speed at
			20 feet. </p>
        <p>In order
			to make predictions of fire intensity change and to determine when and
			where they might occur certain select information is relevant. Identifying
			the kind of information needed for that task is important to enable
			proper focus. Fire behavior information reduces the amount of data commonly
			associated with fire behavior prediction. It simplifies prediction by
			using the fewest number of inputs that are actually causing fire speed
			and intensity variations on a particular segment of the fire. 
        </p>
        <p>The intensities
			and rates of spread observed on a free burning fire adequately describe
			the affects the fire danger is having on the fire. To be able to predict
			a place or time of fire intensity change, the observer must identify
			what is different ahead of the fire. </p>
        <p>When
			conditions are such that only part of the fire behavior variable can
			be dealt with successfully, the fire officer needs to determine the
			fire&#39;s weak spots and attack the fire at those points. The tactician
			can accomplish this using only the fire behavior information.

        <h2>
            <a name="fire behavior tactics statement">Fire Behavior Tactics Statement</a></h2>
        <p>A statement
			that directs resources on a segment of a fire. Used each time incoming
			resources report they are &quot;on scene&quot;. </p>
        <p>Assignments
			to engage a wildland fire and accomplish a control objective should
			be thoughtfully planned. If all you hear is the order to engage the
			fire the plan may not thought out. If the officer cannot explain how
			the tactic selection was decided then the officer may not know the risks.
			It should be imperative to implement a tactic that is viable under the
			fire behavior condition. In order for the engaging fire officer to know
			the plan is well thought out the commanding officer must communicate
			the logic before the order to engage the fire. </p>
        <p>The tactic
			needs to have a basis of logic and contain the cause of fire intensity
			change or contain the basis for the logic that the fire will not change
			for the duration of the engagement. The CPS language gives the supervisor
			the ability to communicate the logic behind the tactic that is selected.
        </p>
        <p>After
			a size-up is made instructions must be given to firefighters who arrive
			on scene. The CPS teaches how to communicate the whole situation that
			exists, the potential for change and the tactic selected. The following
			is an example of a complete fire behavior tactics statement. This is
			not a report on conditions and a request for additional resources.
        </p>
        <p>A complete
			statement includes: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A
				description of the fire scene which includes the type of fire, the
				segment of the fire on the topography and how it is aligned with
				the forces of slope, wind and preheat as well as when and where
				it may change. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>An example:
            <br></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;This
				fire is a topography fire. The fire is running up slope in hot fuel,
				aligned with the wind and is generating 40 foot flame lengths which
				is beyond our threshold of control. The fire is going over the ridge
				and will be out of alignment with wind, slope and in cool fuel within
				the hour and it will then be within our capabilities. Use your resources
				to attack the fire directly where and when it goes out of alignment.&quot;
            </p>

            <a name="fire danger info">Fire Danger Information</a></h2>
        <p>Information
			that is useful in planning but not so useful in fire behavior predictions.</p>
        <p>Fire
			danger information is useful in anticipating resource needs because
			it is an indicator of the difficulty of control of a wildland fire.
			The values of the air mass and the fuel moisture content are fire danger
			information. The values are combined in a formula and when calculated,
			result in a point on a scale of fire danger from low to extreme. The
			fire intensity variances become greater as fire danger increases. The
			fluctuations in the air temperature, relative humidity, fine fuel and
			10 hour fuel stick moisture content are generalized to represent the
			conditions in the area of the fire. Micro climate variations in these
			values are not usually measured and are not easily observed. 
        </p>
        <p>The CPS
			does not use this data to make predictions of fire intensity change.
			Fire danger numbers nor the ingredients which are air temperature and
			humidity to name my favorites, do not explain the variations going on
			at a single point in time on a fire perimeter because they are one value
			and are not meant to describe the degree of variation occurring under
			any fire danger condition. </p>

            <a name="logic">Fire Ground Logic</a></h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Logic to explain the basis of opinions.</strong> </p>
        <p>Fire
			Ground Logic includes valuable input in solving tactical problems while
			intuition rejects disagreement. The primary issue is to realize that
			it is changes in the fire&#39;s rate of spread or intensity that makes a
			fire dangerous. </p>
        <p>There
			are two ways used to deal with the fire changing. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
				One is to post a lookout and react to the change. This is the primeval,
				tried and failed method, thought to provide sufficient margins of
				safety by many at all levels in the fire service. Much is made of
				posting a lookout and little of what the lookout is to do except
				to warn when something happens. </li>
            <li>
				The second way to deal with the fire changing and becoming dangerous
				is to design the engagement tactic from the knowledge of fire behavior
				potential. When the potential reaches a danger threshold the engagement
				is stopped and firefighter evacuation is accomplished. This gets
				the troops out of the way in time but may look bad if the fire doesn&#39;t
				make the run. Nevertheless, this is the only way that some of the
				burnover accidents could have been avoided. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logical
			use of basic causative information (fire behavior information) enables
			one to predict differences in fire intensity by matching observed fire
			behavior and the alignment of forces to the alignment of forces on the
			ground in the fire&#39;s path. </p>
        <p>The intensity
			observed in various alignments is predictably what will reoccur when
			the fireground and fire are in similar alignments. Forecast weather
			changes may or may not be significant and can be included or rejected
			as useful information for prediction of changes. </p>
        <p>Example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Suddenly
				a spotfire is detected. Take action or make predictions? Will there
				be another spotfire? Which way is the condition going? Let us say
				the spotfire came from a fire burning on an east aspect and it spotted
				to a west aspect at 1600 hours. Compared to the fire intensity on
				the east aspect, will the fire behavior be worse or easier? Will
				there be more spotfires? </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The tactics
			should be determined from the answer. The tactics should be defensive
			in this case. The tactical communication should include the reasoning
			behind the opinion. </p>

			safety depends on knowing and communicating this simple prediction of
			the fire&#39;s potential. It is the middle portion of a complete size-up
			statement. </p>
        <p><i>&quot;The
			fire is going into alignment, it is getting worse, we need to adjust
			the tactics to match the condition.&quot;</i> </p>
        <p>This
			simple prediction puts you mentally ahead of the dangers of fire intensity
			changes. Acting on this prediction is far safer than reacting after
			the fire intensity changes. </p>
        <p>The most
			basic question to ask is, which way is the fire behavior going, is it
			getting worse or easier with time? If this question isn&#39;t answered,
			actions cannot be based on expected fire behavior, which is one of the
			10 standard orders. </p>

            <a name="time tagged tactics">Time Tagged Tactics</a></h2>
        <p>A phrase
			which predicts the time period during which a tactic becomes potentially
			dangerous and must be altered.</p>
        <p>Using
			CPS it is possible to predict when and where a fire behavior event will
			be most likely to occur, when and where the fire will gain full alignment
			of forces. This occurred on the Dillon Incident on the 13th of August
			in 1994, refer to page 120. The indirect holding and firing tactic was
			time tagged to halt at 1100 hours. The firefighters were moved off the
			line before the fire made a high intensity run from below. This becomes
			an example of how to do it right. </p>
        <p>Had this
			been done on many of the past fires, burnovers could have been avoided.
			Examples are the Griffith Park fire which critically burned 100 firefighters
			and killed 33, the Mann Gulch fire of 1949 which killed 14 firefighters,
			the Loop fire of 1966 which killed 13, the Spanish Ranch fire that killed
			four firefighters in 1979, the 1994 South Canyon fire that took 14 lives,
			the 1994 fatality Glenn Allen fire that burned over a small crew killing
			two, and the Calabasas fire of 1996 which injured 10 firefighters.

            <a name="types of fires">Types of Fires: Wind Driven, Fuels, Topography</a></h2>
        <p>Identify
			the fire&#39;s type to alert people of the necessity to select an appropriate
			tactic. </p>
        <p>There
			are certain tactics that seem to work better on one type of fire. Sometimes
			tactics become dangerous because the tactic was wrong for the type of
			fire at the outset. Another twist in the situation happens when a fire
			changes from one type to another in the middle of your shift and the
			tactic suddenly does not match the situation. </p>
        <p>Each
			type fire has a matching tactic that is appropriate. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
				Tactics for wind driven fires are to anchor the heel and direct
				attack the flanks, avoiding frontal attack except for use of defensible
				space to protect structures. </li>
            <li>
				Tactics for fuel driven fires too hot for direct attack are to go
				indirect, burning out the area. </li>
            <li>
				Tactics for topography fires must consider the variations on the
				fire ground. These tactics must be based on reasoned prediction
				and change before the fire changes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another
			basic idea is to view time as an important factor on topography fires
			because of the aspect&#39;s variation in solar heating. This variation caused
			by time change is where the time tag came from. </p>
        <p>Tactical
			time tags should be considered when assigning crews to open line on
			all topography fires.</p>

            <a name="what is it telling you">What is the Fire Telling You?</a></h2>
        <p>What
			it did yesterday may repeat today. What does the fire history tell you
			about the South Canyon fire on page 123? The fire burned for three days
			moving downhill, out of alignment. What can we make of that? It isn&#39;t
			going out by itself. The fire will continue to burn while it is out
			of alignment even at night. What does that mean? The fire will continue
			to travel until it gains a position to come into alignment and then
			it will change its rate of spread and intensity for the worse.
        </p>
        <p>The suppression
			effort failed to contain the fire while it is out of alignment. What
			does that mean? It means that the fire is resistant to present control
			efforts. None of what the fire told us is good news and reason would
			presume a &quot;getting worse&quot; situation. </p>
        <p>The fire
			is moving while it is out of alignment and under-burning the oak brush.
			The tops of the under-burned brush are now cooked and dry much like
			frost killed Gamble Oak. The fuel is fire prepared and ready to re-burn.
        </p>
        <p>The fire
			is located below the highly flammable canopy and is in alignment to
			burn the crowns. The fire crept out of alignment from July 2nd to July
			6th backing down off a hilltop. When the fire made its first run July
			6th, 1994 it re-burned a strip of oak canopy that was in full alignment.
			That run should have told us what the potential of the fire was while
			it was in full alignment. We should have understood the fire was in
			full alignment to burn overstory and was about to cross the canyon and
			get in position of full alignment to run the hot slopes to northeast.
			The fire behavior told enough about the potential for change from a
			creeping fire into an inferno to serve adequate warning for those with
			the observation skills to understand what the fire was telling us. Only
			by perceiving the fire behavior potential and altering the tactics before
			the fire went into alignment could this tragedy have been avoided.
        </p>
        <p>Learn
			how to use what the fire is telling you to plan successful tactics.
			Is it starting to spot, torch or make small runs? Which way is the fire
			behavior going? Is it getting worse or easier? When the fire moves or
			the sun moves, you need to know which way fire behavior is going and
			adjust tactics to match the potential. </p>

            <a name="Signature Predictors">Signature Predictors</a></h2>
        <p>There
			are four (4) types of fires that have different causes for the observed
			fire signature.&nbsp; Wind driven, where the dominate force is wind;
			fuels fires where the dominate cause of the behavior is the available
			fuel; fire on fire where the fire and the radiation output becomes the
			dominate force causing the behavior and the topography fire.&nbsp;
            <br><br>The alignment signature is derived from the fire intensity and
			rate of spread due to the various alignments of wind, slope and solar
			preheating, fuel flammability level for topography fires.&nbsp; These
			signatures are used in predicting fire behavior in the path of the fire.&nbsp;
			The logic is that the fire behavior will replicate when the cause of
			the past behavior is understood, and the fire is approaching the same
			alignment of wind, slope and pre-heat values.&nbsp; The accuracy need
			only be the threshold of control level and not rate-of-spread or flame
			length.&nbsp; <br><br>The predictions can be displayed on maps for strategy
