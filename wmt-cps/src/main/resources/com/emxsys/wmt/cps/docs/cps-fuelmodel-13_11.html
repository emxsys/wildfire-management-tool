        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Models 11</h1>
        <h2>Light Logging Slash</h2>
        <h3>Logging Slash Group</h3>
        <p>Fires are fairly active in the slash and herbaceous material intermixed with
            the slash. The spacing of the rather light fuel load, shading from overstory, or
            the aging of the fine fuels can contribute to limiting the fire potential. Light
            partial cuts or thinning operations in mixed conifer stands, hardwood stands, and
            southern pine harvests are considered. Clearcut operations generally produce more
            slash than represented here. The less-than-3-inch (7.6-cm) material load is less
            than 12 tons per acre (5.4 t/ha). The greater-than-3-inch (7.6-cm) is represented
            by not more than 10 pieces, 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter, along a 50-foot (15-m)
            transect. Field examples are shown in photographs 31, 32, and 33.</p>
