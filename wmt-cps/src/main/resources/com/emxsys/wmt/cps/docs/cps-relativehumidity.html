        <h2>Relative Humidity</h2>

        <p>"Saturation of surface air is a condition of favorable fire weather; that is, conductive 
            to low fire danger.  Less favorable are conditions of unsaturation that permit evaporation 
            from forest fuels, increasing their flammability and the fire danger. Relative humidity (RH)
            is the measure of atmospheric moisture in a volume of air to the total amount which that 
            volume can hold at the given temperature and atmospheric pressure.  Relative humidity 
            is the ratio of actual vapor pressure to saturation to near zero for very dry air.  
            Relative humidity depends on the actual moisture content of the air, the temperature, and the pressure."</p>

        <h3>Campbellâ€™s Logic:</h3>

        <P>The thing to remember is that humidity is not the direct cause of fuel moisture changes. 
            Fuel moisture is determined by the heating or cooling of the fuel. During the day, solar
            radiation heats and drys the fuel, and at night re-radiation from the earth 
            cools the fuel.</p>           

        <p>Heating fuel lowers fuel moisture.  Cooling fuel raises fuel moisture.  Heated fuel is 
            more flammable than cool fuel.</p>

        <h3>Practical proof:</h3>

        <p>Lay your hand on your car that is in the sun and feel how hot it is.  It is hotter than 
            the air. And at night, where does the dew form? In the air or on an exposed solid object 
            like your windshield?  So what are the implications of that evidence? Look to fuel 
            temperature to explain the cause of fuel moisture variations on the fireground.  
            Fuel moisture variations are the reason for hot fuel causing hotter
            fire behavior than cool fuel.</p>
