        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 5</h1>
        <h2>Brush (2 feet)</h2>
        <h3>Shrub Group</h3>
        <p>Fire is generally carried in the surface fuels that are made up of
		litter cast by the shrubs and the grasses or forbs in the understory. 
		The fires are generally not very intense because surface fuel loads are 
		light, the shrubs are young with little dead material, and the foliage 
		contains little volatile material. Usually shrubs are short and almost 
		totally cover the area. Young, green stands with no dead wood would 
		qualify: laurel, vine maple, alder, or even chaparral, manzanita, or 
		chamise.</p>

        <p>Photo 13. Green, low shrub fields within timber stands or without
		overstory are typical. Example is Douglas-firâ€“snowberry habitat
		type.<br/></p>

		Area, Idaho.<br/></p>
