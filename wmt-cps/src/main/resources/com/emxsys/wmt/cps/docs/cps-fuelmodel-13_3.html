        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 3</h1>
        <h2>Tall Grass (2.5 feet)</h2>
        <h3>Grass Group</h3>
        <p>Fires in this fuel are the most intense of the grass
            group and display high rates of spread under the influence
            of wind. Wind may drive fire into the upper heights
            of the grass and across standing water. Stands are tall,
            averaging about 3 feet (1 m), but considerable variation
            may occur. Approximately one-third of more of the stand
            is considered dead or cured and maintains the fire. Wild
            or cultivated grains that have not been harvested can be
            considered similar to tall prairie and marshland grasses.
            Refer to photographs 6, 7, and 8 for examples of fuels
            fitting this model.&nbsp;</p>
