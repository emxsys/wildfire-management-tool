        <h2>Terrain</h2>
        <p>Topography that is not flat has more differences in fuel flammability than flat country.  
            The topography variations allow for differing amounts of solar radiation absorbed by 
            fuels. Terrain can also shade adjacent hillsides, creating large variations in fuel 
            temperatures and fuel flammablity.</p>
        <p>Although not presently modeled in the WMT, it should be noted that the diurnal wind 
            change from up canyon to down canyon is caused by differences in heating the fuel bed.  
            Heated air rises, cool air sinks.</p>
