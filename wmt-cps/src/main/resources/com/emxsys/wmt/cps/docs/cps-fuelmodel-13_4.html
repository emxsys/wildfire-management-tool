        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 4</h1>
        <h2>Chaparral (6 feet)</h2>
        <h3>Shrub Group</h3>
        <p>Fires intensity and fast-spreading fires involve the foliage
            and live and dead fine woody material in the crowns
            of a nearly continuous secondary overstory. Stands of
            mature shrubs, 6 or more feet tall, such as California
            mixed chaparral, the high pocosin along the east coast,
            the pinebarrens of New Jersey, or the closed jack pine
            stands of the north-central States are typical candidates.
            Besides flammable foliage, dead woody material in the
            stands significantly contributes to the fire intensity.
            Height of stands qualifying for this model depends on
            local conditions. A deep litter layer may also hamper suppression
            efforts. Photographs 9, 10, 11, and 12 depict
            examples fitting this fuel model.</p>
