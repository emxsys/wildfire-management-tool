        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 7</h1>
        <h2>Southern Rough</h2>
        <h3>Shrub Group</h3>

        <p>Fires burn through the surface and shrub strata with
            equal ease and can occur at higher dead fuel moisture
            contents because of the flammability of live foliage and
            other live material. Stands of shrubs are generally between
            2 and 6 feet (0.6 and 1.8 m) high. Palmetto-gallberry
            understory-pine overstory sites are typical and low
            pocosins may be represented. Black spruce-shrub combinations
            in Alaska may also be represented.
            Photographs
            19, 20, and 21 depict field situations for this model.</p>
