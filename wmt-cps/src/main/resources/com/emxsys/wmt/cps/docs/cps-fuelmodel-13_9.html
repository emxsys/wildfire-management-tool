        <h1>Fire Behavior Fuel Model 9</h1>
        <h2>Hardwood Litter</h2>
        <h3>Timber Group</h3>
        <p>Fires run through the surface litter faster than model 8 and have longer flame
            height. Both long-needle conifer stands and hardwood stands, especially the oak-hickory
            types, are typical. Fall fires in hardwoods are predictable, but high winds will
            actually cause higher rates of spread than predicted because of spotting caused
            by rolling and blowing leaves. Closed stands of long-needled pine like ponderosa,
            Jeffrey, and red pines, or southern pine plantations are grouped in this model.
            Concentrations of dead-down woody material will contribute to possible torching
            out of trees, spotting, and crowning. Some of the possible field situations fitting
            this model are shown in photographs 25, 26, and 27.</p>
