        <h2>Campbell Prediction System (CPS) </h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Following is an overview of the CPS v1.0 software. this version
			contains the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3D Map &amp; Terrain Viewer for selecting and viewing a
				point of interest on the fireground</li>
            <li>Complete Fuel Model Selection: 40 Standard (static and dynamic) and
				the original 13 -- complete with help guides</li>
            <li>Fully interactive: all fire environmental inputs are
				dynamically coupled to fire behavior outputs -- for example, any
				change in location in the map viewer will change the fire
				behavior according to the new location&#39;s slope and aspect. </li>
            <li>Screen layout can be setup to demonstrate the <em>alignment of
				forces</em> concept taught in the Campbell Prediction System
				training.</li>
        </ul>

            <em>Figure 1. Example demonstrating the alignment of forces concept.</em></p>
        <p>
			Figure 1 shows an overview of the CPS software.&nbsp; On the left
			are a series of panels used for controlling and depicting the fire
			behavior inputs.&nbsp; In the center is a map and terrain viewer.&nbsp;
			On the right are the fire behavior outputs.</p>
        <h4>Map / Terrain Viewer</h4>
        <p>The
            <em>Map Viewer</em> is a 3D tool for selecting and viewing the
			location used for fire behavior calculations. Terrain can viewed
			from any&nbsp; perspective and on a variety of maps. The location of
			crosshairs at the center of the map viewer are used to obtain the
			terrain&#39;s slope and aspect, as well a the defining the latitude used
			to determine solar preheating of the fuel.</p>
        <h5>Map Viewer</h5>
        <p><img height="589" src="images/cps_v1-map.JPG" width="385" /><br />
						Figure 2. Map Viewer Crosshairs</p>
        <p>The Map Viewer contains a set of crosshairs at the center of the
			viewer.&nbsp; The location of these crosshairs are used for the
			slope and aspect within the fie behavior calculations.&nbsp; Any
			change in location will be reflected immediately in the Map Location
			panel and the fire behavior panels.</p>
        <h5>View Controls</h5>
        <p>Several buttons are displayed in the lower-left corner of the
			viewer which are used for controlling the view angles, panning and

            <em>Figure 3. &nbsp;Map Location panel showing location of
			crosshairs.</em></p>
        <p>Note that the accuracy of the slope and aspect increases as
			you zoom in on the terrain.</p>
        <h5>Map Layers</h5>
        <p>The Map Layers panel allows control of the maps, imagery, and&nbsp;
			controls and annotations displayed in the map viewer.</p>
        <p>
            <img height="328" src="images/cps_v1-maplayers.JPG" width="358" /><br />
            <em>Figure 4. Map Layers</em></p>
        <p>The Map Layers panel controls which layers are visible.&nbsp;
			The layers are displayed in a tree, which may need to be expanded by
			clicking on handle next to the name. </p>
        <p>Simply check or uncheck the various layers to change the display
			within the map Viewer.</p>

        <h4>
			Alignment of Forces</h4>
        <p>One of the fundamental principles of the Campbell Prediction System method
			 is that firefighters should recognize how the three primary forces of wind, slope and preheat
			control fire behavior.&nbsp; When these three forces are in
            &quot;alignment&quot;, fire behavior is at its worst.</p>
        <p>The CPS Dashboard allows these three forces to be displayed
			together so as to see their alignment.</p>
        <h5>Dashboard</h5>
        <p>
            <img height="592" src="images/cps_v1-forces.JPG" width="358" />
            <br><em>Figure 5. Dashboard with controls arrayed to show Alignment of Forces.</em></p>
        <p>Figure 5 shows the CPS Dashboard configured to show the direction and strength for each of three
			primary
			forces.&nbsp; Fire behavior is greatest when the directional arrows
			are all pointing in a similar direction.</p>
        <h4>Fire Environment</h4>
        <p>Several control panels are used to establish the fire&#39;s
			environment.&nbsp; These controls are all dynamically coupled to the
			fire behavior outputs.&nbsp; Any change to the environment will be
			reflected immediately in the fire behavior displays.</p>
        <h5>Solar Preheating by Date and Time</h5>
        <p><img height="117" src="images/cps_v1-datetime.JPG" width="357" /><br />
            <em>Figure 6. &nbsp;Solar heating and date and time controls.</em></p>
        <p>Solar preheating is controlled by date, time and location.&nbsp;
			This panel allows you to control the date and time.&nbsp; The
			location is controlled by the map viewer.</p>
        <p>The direction of the solar rays is shown within the yellow
			compass rose.</p>
        <h5>Fuel Models</h5>
        <p>
            <img height="188" src="images/cps_v1-fuelmodel.JPG" width="357" /><br />
            <em>Figure 7. &nbsp;Fuel tab showing the selected fuel model with a fuel loading
			graph</em></p>
        <p>The Fuel tab contains a control for selecting a fuel model.&nbsp;
			A graph of the fuel loading is shown for the selected model.&nbsp;
			Clicking the [?] icon will display a help guide with photos for the
			selected model.</p>
        <h5>Feel Moisture Scenarios</h5>
        <p>
            <img height="189" src="images/cps_v1-fuelmoisture.JPG" width="357" /><br />
            <em>Figure 8.&nbsp;Moisture tab showing a selected fuel moisture scenario&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>The Moisture tab allows you to select the initial fuel moistures
			used in the fire behavior calculations.&nbsp; Note that the 1hr dead
			fuel moisture will be adjusted by hourly air temperature, humidity
			and solar heating.</p>
        <h5>Yesterday&#39;s and Today&#39;s Air Temperature</h5>
        <p><img height="189" src="images/cps_v1-airtemp.JPG" width="356" /><br />
            <em>Figure 9. Air Temp tab showing air temperature cycle and
			editable table. </em></p>
        <p>The Air Temp tab allows you to establish the yesterday&#39;s actual
			temperatures and today&#39;s forecasted temperatures.&nbsp; The table is
			used to set the parameters for the hourly temperature curves
			displayed in the chart.</p>
        <p>These values affect the dead 1 hour and cured herbaceous fuel
			moistures.</p>
        <h5>Yesterday&#39;s and Today&#39;s Humidity</h5>
        <p><img height="191" src="images/cps_v1-humidity.JPG" width="358" /><br />
            <em>Figure 10. Humidity tab showing relative humidity cycle and
			editable table.</em></p>
        <p>The Humidity tab allows you to establish the yesterday&#39;s actual
			relative humidity and today&#39;s forecasted relative humidity.&nbsp;
			The table is editable and it is used to set the parameters for the
			hourly temperature curves displayed in the chart.</p>
        <p>These values affect the dead 1 hour and cured herbaceous fuel
			moistures.</p>
        <h5>General Winds</h5>
        <p><img height="189" src="images/cps_v1-wind.JPG" width="357" /><br />
            <em>Figure 11. &nbsp;Wind tab showing general wind speed and
			direction with slider controls </em></p>
        <p>The Wind tab lets you control the general winds used throughout
			the fire behavior calculations.&nbsp; The sliders allow you to
			control the wind speed and the wind direction.</p>
        <p>When experimenting with the effects of wind, you may note that
			the wind speed also has a cooling effect on the fuel.</p>
        <h5>Map Location</h5>
        <p><img height="256" src="images/cps_v1-location.JPG" width="358" /><br />
            <em>Figure 12. Map Crosshairs panel showing current location and
			terrain.&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>The Map Location panel shows the location of the map viewer&#39;s
			crosshairs.&nbsp; This location affects the terrain and aspect, the
			sunrise and sunset times, and solar preheating. </p>

        <h4>Fire Behavior</h4>
        <p>The fire behavior panels display various outputs from the
			Rothermel fire spread equations. All of the fire behavior panels are
			dynamic.&nbsp; That is, any change in time, location, wind, fuel
			model, moisture, air temperature or humidity will be reflected
			immediately in the following panels.</p>
        <h5>Direction of Max Fire Spread</h5>
        <p>
            <img height="253" src="images/cps_v1-maxspread.JPG" width="394" /><br />
            <em>Figure 13. Fire Spread</em></p>
        <p>This dynamic panel shows the direction of maximum spread and the
			flame length.&nbsp; Wind is often a dominating force, but note that
			when the wind speed is low that the terrain aspect and slope become
			a greater influence.</p>
        <p>Experiment with various wind directions and speeds on different
			terrain aspects and slopes to better understand this relationship.</p>
        <h5>Fuel Flammability</h5>
        <p><img height="282" src="images/cps_v1-fueltemp.JPG" width="394" /><br />
            <em>Figure 14. Fuel Temperatures</em></p>
        <p>This dynamic panel shows the computed fuel temperature and air
			temperature at the current location. This chart reflects the solar
			preheating of fuel and responds to changes in location.</p>
        <p>A precept of the Campbell Prediction System method is
			that firefighters should recognize when fuel is, or will be, at its
			peak temperature. Experiment with changes in the terrain aspect to see
			when the hours of peak fuel temperature occur.</p>
        <h5>Haul Chart</h5>
        <p>
            <img height="305" src="images/cps_v1-haulchart.JPG" width="397" /><br />
            <em>Figure 15. Haul Chart</em></p>
        <p>The Hauling Chart is recognizable fire behavior diagram in
			wildland firefighting. The Haul Chart was so named because it infers
			the relative intensity of the fire behavior through graphical
			representations of firefighters working—haul firefighters, equipment
			working—haul equipment, trees torching—haul retardant, and crown
			fire—haul everybody to safety. Since fireline intensity and flame
			length are directly proportional (Byram, 1959)—the larger one gets
			the larger the other gets—and since we can visually assess the flame
			length the Haul Chart is an excellent tool for measuring the safety
			and effectiveness of various fireline resources.</p>
        <p>The fireline interpretations of the Haul Chart are as follows:
